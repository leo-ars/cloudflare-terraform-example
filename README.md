# Deploying Cloudflare Resources with Terraform

This guide demonstrates how to deploy Cloudflare resources using Terraform. Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that allows you to manage and provision cloud infrastructure in a declarative way. Cloudflare is a popular cloud-based platform that provides content delivery network (CDN), DNS, and DDoS protection services.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
- A Cloudflare account. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Terraform configuration files:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

3. Initialize Terraform:

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

4. Review and modify the Terraform configuration files (`*.tf`) as needed to define your Cloudflare resources such as DNS records, page rules, etc.

5. Plan your Terraform configuration to ensure everything is set up correctly:

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

6. Apply the Terraform configuration to create or update your Cloudflare resources:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

7. After applying the changes, Terraform will display the resources it created or updated. You can also log in to your Cloudflare account to verify the changes.
